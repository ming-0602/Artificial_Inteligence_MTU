    "## Description of the Game :Santorini\n",
    "\n",
    "Santorini is a two-player abstract strategy game where players take turns moving their workers and building structures on a 5x5 grid. Each player controls two workers, and the goal is to move one worker to a building of height 3, winning immediately.\n",
    "A turn consists of two phases:\n",
    "- moving a worker to an adjacent space (up to one level higher, not occupied, and not domed)\n",
    "- building on an adjacent empty space (increasing its height by 1, up to a dome at height 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player cannot move and build, they lose. The game combines spatial strategy with height-based objectives, making it ideal for a search tree implementation.\n",

    "### Current Board\n",
    "The CurrentBoard represents the game state, a 5x5 grid where each cell tracks height (0-4) and worker ownership (0=none, 1=Player 1, 2=Player 2). It Contains multiple functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "state_of_board()\n",
    "-state_of_board(): Returns \"U\" (unfinished), \"D\" (draw), \"W1\" (Player 1 wins), or \"W2\" (Player 2 wins), consolidating is_win(), winning_player(), and is_draw() to meet the template’s requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "all_possible_moves(player)\n",
    "- Returns a list of move tuples (wx, wy, nx, ny, bx, by) (worker start, move to, build at), deviating from the template’s board-instance output to work with apply_move() and the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "apply_move(move, player)\n",
    "- Applies a move tuple, creating a new board instance (used instead of direct board returns in all_possible_moves()).\n",
    "\n",
    "is_win(move=None)\n",
    "- Checks if a move reaches level 3 or any worker is on level 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "winning_player()\n",
    "- Returns the winning player (1 or 2) or 0 if none.\n",
    "\n",
    "is_draw()\n",
    "- True if no moves exist for either player.\n",
    "\n",
    "evaluate(player)\n",
    "- Rewards height (10/level), mobility (5/move advantage), level 2 proximity to win (+30), center control (+3), and blocking (+5 near opponent). Terminal states get ±1000, ensuring wins/losses exceed non-terminal evaluations, as the template suggests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Santorini search tree is very large and moves can goes up to 128 move-build pairs per turn with 2 works. Thus, an evalution function and depth limiting are essential, integrated with state_of_borad() for utility assignment in SearchTreeNode.\n",

    "- Players choose to be Player 1 or 2 via a dialog. The board is a 5x5 grid with clickable cells.\n",
    "- Human players left-click to select a worker, move, and build (green/yellow highlights guide steps), with right-click to deselect. The AI uses SearchTreeNode to compute its move.\n",

    "## Testing and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Played as Player 1 and 2 against the AI in the GUI.\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "- The AI consistently blocks the human player from reaching level 3 by building around opponents or reducing their mobility.\n",
    "- It rarely wins itself, often stalling the game until a draw (no moves left) or losing if the human outmaneuvers it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: \n",
    "Move computation takes 1-3 seconds with dynamic depth (2-4), reasonable but suggesting depth may limit strategic planning."
